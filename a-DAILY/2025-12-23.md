## log
* nothing notable today, just a bit sleepy

## reflection
* successes 
	* ran with akiko. efficient use of time
	* even when i didn't want to, i kept up the pace after going to the mall. this is because of my recent schedule adherence
	* finished almost all goals!

* failures 
	* didn't get as much coding done as i had hoped
	
* tomorrow 
	* go faster! you can handle it bro
