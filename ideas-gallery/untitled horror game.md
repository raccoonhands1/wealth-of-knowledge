START [!concept]
a horror game in a house with entirely procedural audio, limited walkable area, decent (dark) graphics, and an emphasis on viscerality
END

> [!phases]
> 1. every sound is procedural (pants sound when walking up stairs is different than walking on flat surfaces)
> 2. music has ray casted audio waves
> 3. audio emission is always directional
