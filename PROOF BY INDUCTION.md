[
1)Prove S_1 is true
2)Prove for any S_n, S_k->S_k+1 is true for k>=1
3)It follows by induction that every S_n is true
]

[
inductive hypothosis is when you assume S_k to be true and then give a reason why S_k+1 is also true
]

[
strong induction is where you prove a lower value than S_k implies S_k+1
]

[
Prove that 
1)first statement S_1 or first several S_n is true
2)prove S_1^S_2^S_3^S_k => S_k+1

EXAMPLE:
any value higher than 8 can be made up of combinations of 5 and 3

1)you can make up 9 and 10 cents out of 3 3's and 2 5's.
2)by assumption, we will assume k-2 exists. Thus we can get (k-2)+3=k+1
which holds true for all values above 8
