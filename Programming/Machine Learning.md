## Unsupervised -- unlabeled
- recommender systems ie: buying habits
## Reinforcement
- do a good job, give good feedback. leave agent in environment, equip it with memorization, 
- environment -> interpreter (reward if applicable) -> state goes to agent -> action -> environment.... cycle continues

>[!example]
> - eProf gets evaluated based on the SETS at the end of quarter
> - throughout the quarter, she can take actions (give lectures, assignments, get indirect feedback (how many students *fall asleep*, *comments on ed discussion*, etc))
> - Optimize her actions!
