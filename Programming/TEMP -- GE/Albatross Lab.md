1. including beaks, (lenses + beaks) 64.7%
2. 30.1% (+ 2.2% if foam & rubber is considered)
3. Natural, but still at an unsustainably high margin
4. Likely from pollution brought on by humans
5. Fragments from plastics like bottles. The most obvious solution is to slowdown the production of non-biodegradable plastics
