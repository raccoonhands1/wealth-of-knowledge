## Surjective 

"""
a function is surjective if for every b exists in B, there is an a that exists in A with f(a) = b
"""

sort of like a->b but a is from set A and b is from set B


## Injective

"""
for all a, a^I exists in A, a != a^I implies f(a) != f(a^I)
"""

## Bijective

"""
being both surjective and interjective
"""

if injective, bijective, or subjective, then it has an [[inverse function]] f^-1

note: [[the pidgeonhole principle]] applies to these...

key observations:
- if a function is injective and surjective, it could imply that A is a transformed version of B or vise versa. 
- If a function is surjective and not injective, it could mean something similar.
- if a function is not surjective, it means at least one value exists that doesnt fit the function manipulation seen in the other examples...
