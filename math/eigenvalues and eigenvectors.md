## eigenvector
"""
a vector that doesn't change the direction of an original vector
"""

## eigenvalue
"""
The scalar multiplier to achieve the eigenvector
"""

note: these are actually really easy concepts, they just sound complicated

To solve for the eigenvalues, 
$$ \lambda_i $$
and the eigenvectors, 
$$\bar x_i$$
of an nxn matrix, 
$$A_1$$
1) Multiply an nxn identity matrix by the scalar
2) Subtract the identity matrix multiple from the matrix A
3) Find the determinant of the matrix and the differentrial 
4) Solve for the values of lambda that satisfy the equation 
$$det(A-\lambda I)= \bar 0$$
5) Solve for the corresponding vector to each lambda


example: 
find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
