A function inverse on 2 sets would look like this

![[Pasted image 20241204103118.png]]

"""
if f: A->B is bijective, then its inverse is the function f^-1: B->A. Those obey the equations f^-1 o f = i_A and f o f^-1 = i_B
"""

ie: if f: R->R defined as f(x) = x^3+1 is bijective, then its inverse is x = y^3 + 1, then solve for y
