# image 

for $$f: A->B$$ 
if $$X \subseteq A$$ then the expression $$f(X)$$ has a special meaning called an image. it means that 

"""
$$ \text{if } X \subseteq A\text{ then the image of X is the set } f(X) = {f(x) : x \in X} \subseteq B$$
"""

# preimage

is similar to image, but it's for its inverse function even if the function doesn't allow for an inverse (is not bijective, see [[surjective (onto B),  injective (one-to-one), and bijective (functions)]])

"""
if Y is a proper subset of B, the preimage of Y is the set f^-1(Y) = {x exists in A : f(x) exists in Y} is a proper subset of A
