some infinities are bigger than others, so we should determine which sets are ultimately bigger, even in infinity

To provide a more robust definition:

"""
$$
\text{Two sets A and B have the same cardinality written |A| = |B| if there exists a} 
$$
$$
\text {bijective function f : A->B. If no such bijective f exists, then the sets have unequal cardinalities} 
$$
"""
$$\text{by this definition, } \mathbb{|N|} = \mathbb{|Z}|$$
although N may seem larger than Z, it's actually not since the values line up 1:1 and there are no duplicate values in either sets

$$\text{contrarily, } \mathbb{|N|} \neq \mathbb{|R|}$$

but how?

Cantor's proof lies in the claim that there are no surjective functions for f: N->R which means in turn there could be no bijective rule for them both (see [[surjective (onto B),  injective (one-to-one), and bijective (functions)]])

# countably and uncountable sets

"""
Suppose A is a set. Then A is countably infinite if $$\mathbb{|N|} = \mathbb{|A|}$$
(if there exists a bijection where N->A)
The set A is countable if it is finite or countably infinite. The set A is uncountable if its infinite and $$\mathbb{|N|} \neq \mathbb{|A|}$$
that is, if A is infinite and there's no bijection N->A
"""

By this definition, $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is countably infinite, but $$\mathbb{R}$$ is uncountable

"""
$$\aleph_0 \text{ is reserved for the cardinality of the natural numbers, thus any countably infinite set has a cardinality } \aleph_0$$
"""

thus, 
$$\mathbb{Z} = \aleph_0$$ and 
$$\mathbb{R} \neq \aleph_0$$
It turns out that 
$$\mathbb{Q} = \aleph_0$$
**since you can actually write out all rational numbers in a list from fraction form..., but you cannot do so for all real numbers** 

"""
$$\text{If A and B are both countably infinite, then so is } A \times B$$
"""

"""
$$\text{If A and B are both countably infinite, then so is }A \cup B $$
