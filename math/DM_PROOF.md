[[Contradictions]]:

for proving sets, you need to first:
 prove x(e)A 

and then 

prove P(a) is true
ie: a(e){x(e)S:P(x)}
prove x(e)A
prove P(a)

To prove A (prop. subset of) B:

just prove
IF a(e)B THEN a(e)A

To prove A=B (A&B are both sets)

just prove
1)A(prop. subset of) B
2)B(prop. subset of) A
