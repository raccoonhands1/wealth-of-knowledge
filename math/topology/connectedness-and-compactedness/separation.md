> A topological space is considered **disconnected** (or **separated**) if it can be broken into two "globs" (disjoint non-empty open sets whose union is the space). Otherwise, it is **connected**.

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].

$$
\text{A \textbf{separation} of } X \text{ is a pair of non-empty, disjoint open subsets } U, V \text{ of } X \text{ such that } X = U \cup V.
$$
