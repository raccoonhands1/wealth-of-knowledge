There are three classifiers for functions:

[[surjective (onto B),  injective (one-to-one), and bijective (functions)]]

there are additionally new notiations to this, [[images and preimages (of functions)]] 

Essentially, functions in discrete math involve how sets might or might not relate to each other...
