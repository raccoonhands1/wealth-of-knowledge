A Leader of Comic Actors in Athens: Persuade the Archon to permit comic
performances alongside serious dramas, introducing humor as a vital component of
public festivals
```

Honored Archon, guardian of our city's festivals and keeper of Athena's sacred calendar—I am Giannis, leader of comic performers, son of Philoxenus, and chronic jokster. I come before you in this year, the 68th Olympiad, here in Athens, greatest of all Hellenic cities, where Zeus himself watches over in awe at our magestic theater. You hold the authority to grant or deny what performances may grace the City Dionysia, for upon your pen rests the bordem or lack-thereof of millions of working adults, aristocrats, and children

I am no mere spokesperson, my actors are disciplined in voice, and quick to wit, unlike any marketplace buffoon or court jester. 

And so what I ask is this: allow the great god Zeus to laugh. For too many years, the theater has been plagued with the cruel realities of the real world, but, is this how we wish for our sons to be raised? Is a child not to find humor in an actor, rather than mere pity? For too many years has the theater's plays played the same tune like a raptured lyre, let us introduce a chorus of laughs and giggles. Let our theater reflect the society we see across the streets! Our city can be more than the tragic tale of old men

If you would be comfortable, close your eyes for just a moment and imagine a brand new play, I call it *Prometheus Steals Fire and Burns His Fingers* set in the theater-- you want to hear more, don't you? This is exactly my point. What is this play about? How ridiculous of a title! We begin now; a dark stage is set and the main actor comes out; Prometheus! Before him lie the fire of Olympus. As he reaches out, he burns his hand directly on the fire and drops it all over the mortal realm! Later, the gods create a small council, to determine who had dropped the fire onto the mortal realm, Prometheus raises his swollen-burnt hand for all to see and says: Perhaps we should ask Hephaestus. IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES!

This is astray from the classical tale we've become so used to, but that's the greatest part! The audience won't be suspecting such humor! 

You may worry: that Comedy might cheapen the festival. Foreign allies attend the Dionysia to witness Athens's cultural supremacy—they come to see our finest plays. So what might they think if we add jokes?

I answer: They will think Athens is confident enough in its image to display it. No more, no less.

And thus You may also worry if there's any artistic merit in seeing jokes and pranks. I emplore you: watch my rehersals! we will be ready in as little as two and a half weeks. You can decide then and there whether or not you would like to see more.

Thus, I conclude; Athens stands at a critical moment: do we continue on our track of great prosperity, or do we dare to innovate? Will our sons remember us for building just what we see before us today? Or will we be remembered not for our innovations, but because we are innovators?
