2. as stated above, odontocetes have asymmetrical skulls to facilitate echolocation
3. their lower jaw (mandibular) has a disjointed / unconnected area in the 'chin' region which facilitates the increased efficiency of ungulfing large volumes of water to filter feed (lunge feed)
4. ```
      context Sea lions: external ear pinna, pelage in brown, rotating pelvis for walking, long pectoral flippers, sexually dimorphic. 
	Seals: earless, cannot rotate pelvis, varied pelage, short pectoral flippers, less sexual dimorphism
   ```
	based on these observations, seals seem to be a closely related common ancestor of sea lions and only vary slightly in their phenological profiles. 
	
	Seals likely move around land less frequently and time efficiently as sea lions due to their small pectoral fins and non-rotating pelvis. 
	
	These profiles lead me to believe that seals are more adapted to environments with small amounts of predators and easy-to-find sustenance
