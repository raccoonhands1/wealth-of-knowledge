| phytoplankton | copepod         | water flea | amphipod | herring |
| phytoplankton | barnacle larvae | water flea | amphipod | herring |
4. since the water flea feeds on phytoplankton (plant-like), this technically classifies them as a herbivore. Since they also prey on larger organisms, like barnacle larvae, they're also considered as a carnivore. since they're at the first level of the hierarchy in both instances they're considered first order
5. phytoplankton -> barnacle larvae -> herring, phytoplankton -> krill -> herring, same as question 2

7. a negative 0_2 indication would mean there's a net loss from the time of recording as compared to the base value it started with since a negative value simply indicates a rate of change vector relative to when the experiment started (24 hours prior)
8. GPP would likely be much greater since gross means amount before deductions by definition whereas net means amount after deductions.
