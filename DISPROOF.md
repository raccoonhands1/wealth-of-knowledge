A disproof is a proof that no proof exists to disprove a statement
]
[
Something known to be true is called a Theorem or proposition, 
Something unknown is called a Conjecture
	ex:
	all perfect numbers are even
	there are infinitely many prime numbers
Something false is simply called false statement 

If a conjecture is proven, people write papers about it...

[
disproof is simply referring to proving an example of when something is false
for example

5|2x for all x
1)but when x=1, the statement falls apart...
